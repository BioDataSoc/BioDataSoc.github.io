#### 1 - Understanding the Bioinformatics Workplace:
The Bioinformatics work environment provides a rich setting for exploration and discovery of a range of knowledge, skills and
understanding. This module enables students to have the opportunity to deepen their understanding of their specific work
environment, by undertaking an enquiry using self-directed learning.
Three strands formulate an integrated approach to this module:
Learning about work - relates to developing the studentsâ€™ knowledge and understanding of their workplace;
Learning through work - examines the acquisition of practical skills in their real working environment;
Learning for work - allows the students' knowledge and skills to develop in a way that is directly relevant to the workplace.
Making strategic decisions, quality issues and control are all part of the workplace, as is mapping business needs and
delivering technology. The module enables students to reflect on their own work practice, critically appraise their own
performance and report on the experience of learning at work, utilizing higher-order evaluative and analytical skills.
Preparation: students will agree a topic related to their work practice with their module tutor and produce a proposal on what
they plan to do. The project will be negotiated on a student-by-student basis and may include mentoring by work-based
supervisors who will assist in the choice of subject on which the student will undertake an enquiry. Students will be required to
submit an enquiry proposal, including a rationale, showing that they have made informed decisions about their intended topic.
Implementation: Students will develop and maintain a reflective learning log as part of their ePortfolio, to be used as the basis
of tutorial work and formative assessment to support this module and their continuing studies. They will participate in facilitated
online discussions and Wiki activities, including peer assessment. Students will be encouraged to consider a diversity of
learning strategies and to be imaginative in their proposed assessment vehicle(s). The final submission will include the
ePortfolio.
Students will be expected to demonstrate skills in information gathering, research and analysis, and an awareness of ethical
issues relevant to their practice and studies. Successful completion of this module will demonstrate, amongst other qualities,
the ability to self-evaluate, to self-manage, and to respond constructively to guidance; all qualities much valued by modern
employers.

#### Goals include:
> The student will be tasked with identifying the following aspects of the work setting:
>

>> 
>> Maintenance of professional and ethical standards
>> 
>> Organisational culture and goals
>> 
>> Evaluation of professional/occupational practice/procedures
>>
>> Effective team working
>>
>> Communication in the work place - between workers, stakeholders and customers / clients

>The student will develop the following skills:
>
>> Generic and transferable workplace skills
>>
>> Developing reflective practice, with self-assessment of skills, understanding and attributes for the work sector and learning
>>
>> Managing own time and resources
>>
>> Investigative skills and techniques
>> Effective communication - description, discussion, evaluation and analysis
>>
>> Introduction to personal development and planning mentoring
>>
>> Proposal formulation, project planning and management
>>
>> The nature of learning outcomes and of appropriate assessment method(s)
>
> Analyse the relationship between theoretical perspectives, and workbased and key transferable skills required to support learning in the
workplace.
>
> Critically analyse a business domain; highlight issues and identify
opportunities for improvement through evaluating systems in relation to
their intended purpose and effectiveness.
>
> Negotiate, plan and carry out an appropriate study in a work-related
context, reflecting on and analysing the relationship between
organisational culture and goals and specific practice.
>
> Present, using appropriate technology, an evaluative account of their
learning.

#### 2 - Databases, Management and Analytics

Databases are used to store and process data. Data are accessible through various interfaces such as web pages, APIs
(Application Programming Interface), or SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) endpoints. In this module,
students will explore the main databases available for the different types of biological entities (DNA, genomes, RNA and
proteins), the databases representing biological concepts (e.g. cladistics, taxonomy and ontology), and other biological
databases, including those covering gene expression, protein-protein interactions and orthologues. Students will learn how to
find resources, and how to design and perform a query to retrieve specific data. They will apply this knowledge in order to
cross-link data from different databases. Students will also learn how to perform statistical analysis to evaluate retrieved data.
In this module, students will learn about the key features of different database systems and consider cases where these
different features are useful. Focusing on a relational database, students will explore the possibilities and the limitations of
such database management systems (DBMSs). In medical science, databases contain patient personal information. Students
will be introduced to the ethics of data usage and constraints surrounding such sensitive data.


#### Goals include:
> Major bioinformatics databases - knowing their categories and understanding their interfaces
>
> Relationship (cross-linking) between databases
>
> Different types of database systems, and usage of RDBMS in particular
>
> Formulate a query and determine the appropriate database in which to
apply the query, with regard to the elements available (e.g. sequences,
identifiers, gene/protein/molecule name) and the biological question at
hand.
>
> Design a basic relational database schema in order to store complex
biological entities and develop quality checks for data integrity according
to the data model in question.
>
> Run a query, obtain and parse results, and carry out statistical analysis on
datasets to evaluate relevance and quality.
>
> Store the results in a relational database, in a program-accessible
manner.
