### General Comments

We all need to acknowledge our achievements, this could be anything
from beginning to learn a new skill to absolutely smashing your
Biochemistry exam out of the water.

For example:

Damon-Lee Pointon has been learning to play the Irish Bouzouki... 
we don't have to mention that he hasn't picked it up in a year or two.
