# Welcome to the BioData Society Newsletter/blog
This bi-monthly newsletter we hope will be a place to inform everyone of upcoming events,  which wil be posted on this website as
 well as emailed (if you are signed up to the mailing list).

The purpose of this is make sure everyone is on the same page when it comes to
 university and society events, for mentors to know what their apprentices are up to
 as well as a way to highlight anything that may be of benefit to the group such as
 educational tours to local and national scientific sites and off-site talks.
 
## First Newsletter - 17/04/2020
First off, I'd like to say a big thanks you to everyone who is joining the
 society or is supporting its shear existence. To the managers, mentors and
  members who have helped shape it thus far, Thank you.

#### And now, the News...
Apart from the global pandemic that is forcing us to all life as hermits,
 it looks as though much of university life will stay the same. Exams will
 still be held this May with 50% more time and lectures are still going
  ahead albeit now online.
  
Anglia Ruskin is also now implementing a 'No Detriment Policy', designed to
 acknowledge that students may not be able to study to their fullest when not attending
 the university, due to a variety of factors. This policy ensures that the highest
  grade a student receives for an assessment in a module will be the minimum grade
   for that entire module.

So for example you have a 10% assessment in which you achieve an 80% grade, congratulations
 you have just got 80% for the entire module. If you got 50% in the first assessment and
  75% in the second, your module grade is 75%.

This is on the provision that each assessment receives at least a pass grade,
 so it's best to not use it as an excuse to slack off.
 
##### Future additions for the beginning of term:
This newsletter will also act as a location for mentors (if your not an apprentice then don't worry)
to find your reading lists and outlines of your modules.

There will also be a spot to show case any achievements gained by members of our society in the previous trimester.

Another spot for events. 

#### Thanks for reading
