# Welcome to the BioData Society's Trimester Newsletter/blog
The purpose of this is make sure everyone is on the same page when it comes to
 university and society events, for mentors to know what their apprentices are up to
 as well as a way to highlight anything that may be of benefit to the group such as
 educational tours to local and national scientific sites and off-site talks.

## Newsletter 2 - 13/10/2020
Once again thanks to everyone joining the society and apologies for not informing you about our next moves.
We are currently in talks with Sanger who would like to be our sponsors for events in the future (such as seminars)
which is fantastic seeing as they are world leaders in genomic research.

#### And now, the News...
Apart from the global pandemic that is still forcing us to all life as
hermits and in small social bubbles...

Many of us are working from our own space on out small bubbles with online
laboratories and online lectures as University relies heavily on
Microsoft Teams this year.

In this time please make sure you look after your mental health and try
something new and different every so often to keep that brain moving. 
I for instance just made a TwitterBot (Terry the TwitterBot) whose sole purpose is to annoy
people when i'm playing a game with that person, mostly because I need the advantage when playing PvP.

Hopefully we can see people once again some day and we can all hate each other for
the flood of "Haven't seen you since last year" jokes. Now back to university...

[University-wide Academic Calendar](https://web.anglia.ac.uk/anet/academic/public/calendar_20-21.pdf).
 
Because of COVID-19, the no detriment policy will continue to be in place.
This is calculated as the average of your modules in the same level
(e.g. Year 1 = Level 4, Year 2 = Level 5)
as long as you get a pass mark for the assessments (40%).

#### This Term
For the Bioinformaticians (To be shared with Line managers and Mentors).

#### 1 - Foundations of Cell Biology:

Foundations of Cell Biology is designed to provide an introduction to the cellular basis of life, focusing on their nature and
roles of different cell types, including animal, plant and microbial cells. The module provides students with a basic
understanding of biological organisation and biochemical processes at the cellular level. As such Foundations of Cell Biology
is a core module for students taking the Biomedical Science and Bioscience degree courses. The module introduces and
examines the different types of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, their identifying characteristics properties and key structural
differences. The role of viruses as cellular parasites is also considered. It also explores the basics of cell structure and
function, focusing on cell membranes and organelles, cellular energetics, the cell growth and division cycle, paying particular
attention to mitosis and meiosis. Understanding cell structure and function also requires a basic knowledge of the nature, roles
and chemical structures of key biomolecules, namely carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids and proteins. As well as providing
subject specific knowledge, relevant to biomedical sciences, this module helps develop a number of transferable skills
including practical (laboratory) techniques and skills relevant to employment including literacy and numerical skills. Standard
texts are available via the library and online companion website.

This has also included a variety of visualisation techniques such as Chromatography, Electronmicroscopy and X-ray Crystalography.

#### Goals include:
> Demonstrate a knowledge and understanding the structural differences
between viruses, prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells and the role of the
major eukaryotic cell organelles.
>
> Describe the nature and organisation and basic structure of the genetic
material in viruses, prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and the activities
taking place during the cellular growth and division cycle.
>
> Describe the basic structure and functions of key macromolecules and the
ways in which cells obtain and utilise energy.
>
> Make simple biological calculations and perform some of the basic
laboratory techniques used in the handling, studying and identification of
different cell types and organelles and their functions.

#### Assessed by:

> Essential Cell Biology

> Recomended:
>
> Concepts of Genetics - Very handy book but there are some cases where terminology isn't what you're expecting.
>
> Practical skills in biomolecular sciences - Great for understanding the practical aspects of Biology and the methods which are best to use.

#### Recommended Time Allowance:

> 150 Hours for the Term
>
> 12.5 Hours per Week

#### Minimum Time Allowance:

2 - Computational Methods and Algorithms

>Builds sound knowledge of the application of algorithms in bioinformatics. 
>Basic algorithms are introduced via pseudocode.
>The data-structures required for efficient storage and processing of data will be introduced.
>Simple worked examples will be used to teach the core algorithms for sequence alignment,
>clustering and phylogenetics.
>

with the one book suggested for purchase being:
[Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Grokking+Algorithms%3A+An+illustrated+guide+for+programmers+and+other+curious+people&qid=1588767673&sr=8-1)
which is a Â£20 picture book, so that's a bonus! It's also free at: [Grokking Algorithms](https://livebook.manning.com/book/grokking-algorithms/chapter-1/) with some of the chapters being audio too.
